**Sea turtles** (superfamily **Chelonioidea**), sometimes called **marine turtles**, are reptiles of the order:[Testudines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testudines) and of the suborder [Cryptodira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptodira). The seven existing species of sea turtles are the:

- [flatback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatback_sea_turtle),
- [green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_sea_turtle),
- [hawksbill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawksbill_sea_turtle), 
- [leatherback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leatherback_sea_turtle), 
- [loggerhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loggerhead_sea_turtle), 
- [Kemp's ridley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemp%27s_ridley_sea_turtle),
- [olive ridley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_ridley_sea_turtle)

All six of the sea turtle species present in US waters (all of those listed above except the flatback) are listed as endangered and/or threatened under the [Endangered Species Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act_of_1973). The seventh sea turtle species is the flatback, which exists in the waters of Australia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. Sea turtles can be separated into the categories of hard-shelled ([cheloniid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheloniidae)) and leathery-shelled ([dermochelyid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermochelyidae)). There is only one dermochelyid species which is the leatherback sea turtle.



## Description
For each of the seven types of sea turtles, females and males are the same size; there is no [sexual dimorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism).

In general, sea turtles have a more [fusiform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusiform) body plan than their [terrestrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_animal) or freshwater counterparts. This tapering at both ends reduces volume and means that sea turtles cannot retract their head and limbs into their shells for protection, unlike many other turtles and tortoises. However, the streamlined body plan reduces friction and drag in the water and allows sea turtles to swim more easily and swiftly.

The leatherback sea turtle is the largest sea turtle, measuring 2–3 m (6–9 ft) in length, 1–1.5 m (3–5 ft) in width, and weighing up to 700 kg (1500 lb). Other sea turtle species are smaller, being mostly 60–120 cm (2–4 ft) long and proportionally narrower.

The skulls of sea turtles have cheek regions that are enclosed in bone. Although this condition appears to resemble that found in the earliest known fossil reptiles (anapsids), it is possible it is a more recently evolved trait in sea turtles, placing them outside the anapsids.
## Distribution and habitat
Sea turtles can be found in all oceans except for the polar regions. The [flatback sea turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatback_sea_turtle) is found solely on the northern coast of Australia. The [Kemp's ridley sea turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemp%27s_ridley_sea_turtle) is found solely in the Gulf of Mexico and along the East Coast of the United States.

Sea turtles are generally found in the waters over [continental shelves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_shelf). During the first three to five years of life, sea turtles spend most of their time in the pelagic zone floating in seaweed mats. [Green sea turtles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_sea_turtle) in particular are often found in Sargassum mats, in which they find food, shelter and water. Once the sea turtle has reached adulthood it moves closer to the shore. Females will come ashore to lay their eggs on sandy beaches during the nesting season.

Sea turtles migrate to reach their spawning beaches, which are limited in numbers. Living in the ocean therefore means they usually migrate over large distances. All sea turtles have large body sizes, which is helpful for moving large distances. Large body sizes also offer good protection against the large predators (notably sharks) found in the ocean.

In 2020, diminished human activity resulting from the COVID-19 virus caused an increase in sea turtle nesting. Some areas in Thailand saw an abnormally high number of nests, and Florida experienced a similar phenomenon. Less plastic and light pollution could explain these observations.

## Importance to ecosystems

Sea turtles play key roles in two habitat types: oceans and beaches/dunes. In the oceans, sea turtles, especially green sea turtles, are among the very few creatures (manatees are another) that eat sea grass. Sea grass needs to be constantly cut short to help it grow across the sea floor. Sea turtle grazing helps maintain the health of the sea grass beds. Sea grass beds provide breeding and developmental grounds for numerous marine animals. Without them, many marine species humans harvest would be lost, as would the lower levels of the food chain. The reactions could result in many more marine species eventually becoming endangered or extinct.

Sea turtles use beaches and [sand dunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_dunes) as to lay their eggs. Such coastal environments are nutrient-poor and depend on vegetation to protect against erosion. Eggs, hatched or unhatched, and hatchlings that fail to make it into the ocean are nutrient sources for dune vegetation and therefore protecting these nesting habitats for sea turtles, forming a positive feedback loop.

Sea turtles also maintain a symbiotic relationship with yellow tang, in which the fish will eat algae growing on the shell of a sea turtle.
